# MalHub
MalHub is a program writen fully in Batch, which lets you download malicious software from a database. Having a lot of malware types to choose from like Worms, Trojans, Ransomware and other malicious stuff. MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND SHOULD ONLY BE TESTED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS LIKE VIRTUAL MACHINES. All malware was taken from repo's available on github. (Do not edit MalHub, but do whatever you want with the malicious stuff)
Currently it only has 9 types of malicious software.

SOME FILES DONT WORK, ITS NOT MY FAULT I WILL TRY TO FIX SOME OF THEM.


Planning to add:
- RAT's

Added a GUI using Python, to make it look better, a lot of new updates are gonna be coming to the gui, for now you can still download the .exe file, the file will be removed in the future
