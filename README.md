MalHub was made for easily downloading malicious software for testing and understanding how it affects the target system.

## Installation
Running the program is just as simple as running the .exe, .bat or the python file (the python version is still buggy and may not work as expected).

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to the project by reporting bugs, due to me still not having set up a bug report system you will need to email me about the bug.
It should contain info like.
Your Windows version (Windows 7 , 8 or later).
Describe how the bug happened and in what conditions.
Attach a photo.
Add the LOG file (if there are issues with installation, the LOG file doesnt always work on the python version of MalHub).


## Issues
The issues (or bugs) are mostly with the downloads and the files containing non working malicious software. Because all the malicious files were taken from another github repo which you can find in the SpecialThanks.md file.
Im trying my best to fix all of these issues, but finding the exact malware is really hard.
