             Update Log
Disk Space Check Removed:

Removed the code that checked for available disk space before downloading files to simplify the script and prevent parsing errors.
Confirmation Prompt Before Download:
Added a prompt for users to confirm (Y to proceed or N to cancel) before each download starts. This ensures that downloads only proceed if the user explicitly confirms.
Improved Error Handling:

Simplified the download error handling to log only download failures or successes, avoiding retry loops.
Each successful download logs with timestamp in log.txt, along with any download failures.
Cleaned Up Menu Flow:

Streamlined the menu to prevent crashes on invalid input.
Users are notified if they select an invalid option and are redirected to the menu to try again.

Log File Enhancements:
Expanded the log.txt file with timestamps to better track each download session, including failure and success messages.

CHANGED FILE FROM BAT TO EXE
